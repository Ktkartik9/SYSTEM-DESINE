## 1. Class and Object

- A **Class** is a blueprint for creating objects.
- An **Object** is an instance of a class.
- Created a `Student` class with `name`, `age`, and `gender` attributes.
- Created an object `s1` using the `Student` class.

## 2. Constructor (`__init__`)

- Learned about the `__init__()` constructor method.
- Used the constructor to initialize object attributes.
- Learned how to pass values while creating an object.

## 3. Instance Methods

- Created methods inside a class.
- Implemented the `display()` method to print student information.
- Implemented the `get_age()` method to return the student's age.

## 4. Inheritance

- Learned how inheritance allows one class to acquire properties and methods from another class.
- Created an `Animal` parent class.
- Created a `Dog` child class that inherits from the `Animal` class.
- Accessed parent class attributes and methods through the child class.

## 5. `super()` Function

- Learned how to use the `super()` function.
- Used `super().__init__(name, age)` to call the parent class constructor.
- Reused parent class initialization code without repeating it in the child class.

## 6. Polymorphism

**Polymorphism means "Many Forms".**

- Allows the same method name to behave differently depending on the object.
- Different classes can have methods with the same name but different implementations.
- Helps achieve flexibility and code reusability.

## 7. Method Overriding

- Learned how method overriding works in Python.
- Created a `move()` method in the `Animal` parent class.
- Overrode the `move()` method in the `Dog` child class.
- When `dog.move()` is called, Python executes the `Dog` class implementation instead of the parent implementation.

## 8. Using `super()` with Inheritance

- Used `super().__init__(name, age)` to call the parent class constructor.
- Reused parent class attributes in the child class.
- Avoided unnecessary code duplication.

## 9. Encapsulation

- Encapsulation is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept that combines data and methods into a single class.

- It also restricts direct access to certain attributes and methods to protect data from unwanted modifications.

## 10. Private Attributes

- Created a `Bank` class.
- Used `__balance` as a private attribute.
- Private attributes cannot be accessed directly using their original name outside the class.
- Used Python's name mangling mechanism to restrict direct access.

## 11. Getter Method

- Created a `get_balance()` method.
- Used it to access and display the private balance.
- Provides controlled access to private data.

## 12. Setter Method

- Created a `set_balance()` method.
- Used it to update the private balance.
- Allows modification of private attributes through a class method.

## 13. Private Method

- Created a private method `__isServerLive()`.
- Used it to check whether the bank server is running.
- Private methods are intended for internal use within the class.


## 14. Abstraction

Abstraction is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept that hides implementation details and shows only the essential functionality to the user.

- Focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.
- Helps create a common structure for related classes.
- Improves code organization and maintainability.

## 15. Abstract Base Class (ABC)

- Imported `ABC` from the `abc` module.
- Created an abstract class named `Shape`.
- Inherited the `ABC` class to make `Shape` an abstract base class.
- An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly.

## 16. Abstract Methods

- Used the `@abstractmethod` decorator.
- Created two abstract methods:
  - `area()`
  - `perimeter()`
- Abstract methods define a common structure that child classes must implement.
- Used `pass` because the actual implementation is provided by the child class.

## 17. Concrete Class

- Created a `Rectangle` class that inherits from the `Shape` class.
- Implemented the `area()` and `perimeter()` methods.
- Initialized `length` and `breadth` using the constructor (`__init__`).
